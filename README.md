# linking
Simulations and IRT linking for three or more tests of the same construct

This repository contains open-access tools for researchers to link assessments of the same construct. It includes R scripts with simulations to detect DIF on one item, and linking via IRT approaches. It will eventually contain scripts for linking with traditional equating/scaling procedures.
